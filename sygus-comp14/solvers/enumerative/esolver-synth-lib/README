To compile the enumerative solver, simply do

make -j <# cores> eoptlto

in this directory. If that fails with some linker errors, then your
C++ compiler does not have full support for link-time
optimizations. Try the following instead

make -j <# cores> eopt

PREREQUISITES:
The solver REQUIRES a C++11 compliant compiler. This means LLVM 3.4+
or g++ 4.8.2+. 

The solver requires boost libraries.

Please ensure that you have all the prerequisites before filing any
bug reports.

Please report bugs at
https://github.com/rishabhs/sygus-comp14/issues and DO NOT email
individual developers. This helps keep everyone in the loop.
